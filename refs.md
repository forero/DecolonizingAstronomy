> "The infusion of funds increased the scientific workforce and the number of products marketed to scientists, 
but did little to boost excellence. It brought about a 'quantity, not quality' approach that is the antithesis 
of what science should be about. It fuelled an idea that academic science is a business that has to sustain 
constant yearly growth. This 'businessization' of science, with its emphasis on job creation and translatability, 
is undermining the freedom of ideas that allows huge, often unpredictable, progress."
